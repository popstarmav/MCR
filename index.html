        <h3>About $MCR</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Memecoin Reserve ($MCR). We’re here giving back to the memecoin world. Launched on Pump.fun and powered by Solana, $MCR tackles rug pulls head-on by sharing 25% of profits as Meme Dividends—split between holders and scam victims every quarter (April, July, October, January) if we meet our target. Why 25%? It’s fair: 12.5% supports scam victims, helping those hurt by rug pulls, and 12.5% rewards holders, encouraging community participation. The remaining 75% of profits is retained to fuel $MCR’s growth, ensuring sustainability by covering development, marketing, and operations, allowing the project to thrive long-term.

            This quarterly payout rule also applies to any other memecoins we launch in the future. Whether ist’s a new coin inspired by $MCR’s vision or a different memecoin project, the same principle of quarterly distributions—contingent on meeting a target—will guide our approach, creating a consistent and transparent reward system across our ecosystem. This commitment reflects our dedication to building a supportive memecoin community</p>
