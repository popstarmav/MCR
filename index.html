        <h3>MEMECOINS RESERVE CURRENCY</h3>
        <p>The Memecoin Reserve ($MCR) is a revolutionary meme token that combines the power of memes with the stability of a reserve currency. With a focus on community and fairness, $MCR aims to provide a fun and rewarding experience for its holders while also supporting the fight against rug pulls and scams. We’ll check profits at the end of each quarter and pay out 25% of profits, split fairly: 12.5% for holders, 12.5% for victims, keeping $MCR strong and supportive!</p>

        <h3>About $MCR</h3>
        <p>The payout consists of 25% of profits, split evenly: 12.5% goes to holders as a reward for their support, and 12.5% supports scam victims, aligning with $MCR’s mission to fight rug pulls and foster a fair community. If the goal isn’t met, no payout occurs for that quarter, and profits roll over to the next evaluation period, ensuring the project’s sustainability.

            This quarterly payout rule also applies to any other memecoins we launch in the future. Whether ist’s a new coin inspired by $MCR’s vision or a different memecoin project, the same principle of quarterly distributions—contingent on meeting a target—will guide our approach, creating a consistent and transparent reward system across our ecosystem. This commitment reflects our dedication to building a supportive memecoin community</p>
